The application is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, catering to administrators, professors, and students. Administrators can manage departments, schedules, and track absences, while professors can record and review attendance data in real-time. Students register their presence using QR codes or facial recognition, enhancing both accuracy and speed.The project uses a microservices architecture, integrating the facial recognition module via Flask, while the backend is built using Spring Boot, the frontend with React.js, and data stored in MySQL/SQLite. This solution addresses the inefficiencies of manual attendance management, offering a more reliable and automated system for educational institutions, and exemplifies my ability to design and implement full-stack solutions with modern technologies."
